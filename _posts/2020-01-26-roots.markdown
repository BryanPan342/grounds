Tucked away in a neighborhood in Culver City, **Bar Nine** roasts, brews, and serves *Third Wave* coffee. Blink once, you would have seen a warehouse. Blink twice, you would have completely missed it. Walls of brick and mortar, a large glass door, and a generic chain-link fence is the only indication that you are remotely in the right place. As the saying goes, "if you know, you know".

Wait, wait, wait. Let's take a step back. What is *Third Wave* coffee? And what happened to waves one and two??? Quick history lesson, in the mid 1800s, coffee became a commercialized commodity: think Folgers, Maxwell Coffee House, instant coffee. *First Wave* coffee in many ways sacrificed quality and taste for mass-produced and affordable coffee. Simply put, it tasted like shit. 
<br/>  
Moving into the 1970s, companies like Peet's and Starbucks looked to provide better quality coffee at a higher premium: think back to those 5 dollar, sugary latte days of your youth. While there was some emphasis on coffee origin, *Second Wave* coffee primarily focused on mass-sourcing better beans and unsubstantial, specialty drinks. If *First Wave* coffee was a pig, *Second Wave* coffee is like slapping lipstick on a cute baby pig called Stacy.
<br/>  
Finally, we arrive at *Third Wave* coffee. Many people define *Third Wave* coffee as the proliferation of specialty coffee, but I would go as far as say *Third Wave* coffee is a love for the quality of the entire supply chain that results in a cup of coffee: think of terms like Single Origin, pour-over, complexity, direct trade. In many ways, *Third Wave* coffee is an experience revolved solely on the customer's appreciation for good coffee. You can think of it like wine: massive care and appreciation towards sourcing, storytelling, and quality of the product.

Alright, now back to **Bar Nine**. **Bar Nine** is textbook, LA, *Third Wave* cafe. In many ways, it is a dichotomy of understated design and deeply impassioned coffee, a refreshing alternative from beautiful cafes with subpar coffee. Jack, their in-house roaster, roasts fresh beans every Monday starting from 7 a.m. and has amazing insight into the source and story of their beans. In fact, Jack told me that they actually work directly with international suppliers to source their beans to ensure the very best for us, their customers. 
<br/>  
With in-house roasting, friendly and knowledgable staff, *and* great coffee, **Bar Nine** is by far one of my favorite places to go to simply just enjoy a cup of good coffee. As an environmentally conscious organization, **Bar Nine** strives to reduce waste caused by the consumption this magical bean water: ranging from a glass takeaway program (instead of paper cups, they give you glass bottles to go \**which you can bring back for a discount*\*) to natural lighting, solar power to recycled napkins. 
<br/>  
If you want to dip your toy into the deep, deep world of coffee, **Bar Nine** is an amazing place to start your *Third Wave* journey. Ultimately, if you are paying a high premium for your coffee, not only does the coffee have to be amazing, but you must also experience and feel the passion baristas have towards their craft. **Bar Nine** is rooted in transparency between the staff's knowledge and love for coffee and a customer's needs. If I were to pick a place to completely immerse myself in specialty coffee, **Bar Nine** would be the place I would begin growing my roots.
