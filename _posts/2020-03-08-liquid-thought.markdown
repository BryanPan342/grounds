The sun is rising right now. The sky is a full light blue with rays of light peeking through tall trees and buildings. I'm sipping my coffee. It's a little over-extracted, but that's okay. It's way too early to be writing about coffee. To be completely transparent, I didn't go to a coffee shop this week. It's not because I didn't have the time, I just didn't feel like going to one. For this post, I want to expose my mind and pour my thoughts onto writing. I want my liquid thoughts to solidify in prose.

I have no idea why I didn't feel like going to a coffee shop this week. It's not that I didn't have time and I certainly didn't run out of places to go. Maybe like an over-extracted coffee, I just exposed myself too much, too quickly, for far too long. To clarify, I'm not sick of coffee. I'm definitely far from it. Honestly, it's kind of crazy to think that it's been 10 weeks in the making for this little blog of mine. There have definitely been some posts that are far superior than others in my eyes, but **The Grounds of the City** was always meant to simply be a breeding ground for my tender thoughts.

Honestly, it baffles me that I'm doing this. I'm chuckling thinking about the absurdity of this blog and how far my passion for coffee has brought me. I originally came into **The Grounds of the City** with no expecations on how it would look or any bearings on the type of content. I dived in thinking that I would simply "figure it out" as I went along. I honestly don't know, and don't care, if anyone reads these posts besides myself. This little blog of mine has essentially become a diary of anything from my absurd assumptions to snobbish takes on bean water. 
<br/>  
As my 9th post, this very post marks 10 weeks since I started this project. I never really thought about where I wanted this to go. But looking back at where it all started, I'm quite happy to see how **The Grounds of the City** has evolved over time. Of course, there is so much that I wish I could change about the blog (I mean let's be honest, it looks like shit right now). I really hope to continue this hobby of mine beyond this quarter at school. Again, no expectations moving forward, and extremely excited to see where the future takes me.
