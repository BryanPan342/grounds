Let's talk about sustainability. According to the National Coffee Association (NCA), 2.25 billion cups of coffee are consumed every single day. On top of k-cups and the 140 liters of water it takes to make a single cup of coffee, coffee consumption has a nontrivial impact on the environment. With growing interests towards promoting sustainable practices, cafes like <a href="https://www.groundsofthecity.com/opinions/2020/01/26/roots.html" target="_blank">Bar Nine</a> and **Coffee Connection** are taking off in the coffee-making business of doing things right.
<br/>  
As a non-profit cafe, **Coffee Connection** was founded upon the notion of serving the greater community than a large corporation. They source their beans from <a href="https://groundsforchange.com/" target="_blank">Grounds for Change</a>, a Fair Trade and Carbon-Free roaster based in Seattle, and <a href="https://www.bicyclecoffeeco.com/" target="_blank">Bicycle Coffee Roasters</a>, a coffee roaster that only delivers by bike. Furthermore, **Coffee Connection** proactively partners with the community by supporting local businesses and schools.

To be completely honest, the coffee isn't amazing. Personally, I wouldn't come to **Coffee Connection** if I wanted to get blown away by an amazing cup of coffee. Since it is a non-profit cafe, their coffee is pretty affordable. I paid $3.50 for a cappuccino which ended up tasting pretty good considering the price I paid for it. However, the thing I loved most about **Coffee Connection** was the space their provided.

**Coffee Connection** has an outdoor baroque courtyard dabbled with foliage and shade. If you are looking for a place to work during the day, I would highly recommend coming here. There is just something peaceful sitting in **Coffee Connection** that gives off inspirational vibes. I will say that, at least for the day I went, it gets pretty crowded and seating for a large group can be diffcult. Having been established in 2000, **Coffee Connection** has definitely found a community in Los Angeles focused on sustainability. 
<br/>  
Personally, I would come to **Coffee Connection** primarily for the space they provide and their mission. I believe in their mission towards promoting Fair Trade and Carbon-Free practices and I think they have developed a devoted community revolving around sustainability. In some ways, I would characterize them more as Second Wave coffee than Third Wave coffee. This is not to say that their coffee is terrible, Second Wave coffee just means an emphasis on the cafe itself rather than the specifics of coffee. To close, **Coffee Connection** is a non-profit cafe that provides an inspiration space for people to chase their dreams starting with a sustainable cup of coffee.
