Honestly, I have been putting this off for a while now. It has almost been a month since I have last posted on this blog. When I look back at the content I created before, I give a wry smile towards my oblivity (yes I made this word up because it sounds cooler than obliviousness) at the greater situation at large. COVID-19 has undoubtedly affected us all but, while it may seem terrible at first, I have faith that COVID-19 will spark great change in society that is beneficial to all of us.
<br/>  
Personally, I now look back at all the things I have taken for granted with newfound appreciation. This once-in-a-century disease that is rampaging across the world has made me really assess the little things in life. Anywhere from making coffee for my friends to walking into a new coffee shop, I truly miss the little things about this hobby of mine. Of course, I am grateful for so much more that is unrelated to coffee, but then again this is a blog about coffee.
<br/>  
I really hope that the people I have met throughout my coffee adventure are doing well. I know that these times are hard for everyone, but especially small businesses, so wishing them all the best. It truly is the people that you meet in your journey who define your story. There have been wonderful baristas and random people that I have met at coffee shops that defined my love for coffee. And it's sadly poetic how only in times like these do we stop to think about how important those people are in our development.
<br/>  
In an age of social distancing, I will no longer have the luxury of walking into a new coffee shop and posit opinions of taste. Instead, I want to talk about the under-the-rug, nerdy stuff that really gets my blood pumping when it comes to coffee. Anywhere from 'how to make coffee', 'how can I start making great coffee', or 'why do we even use water as our solute' are all questions I want to talk about and hopefully spark interest in someone else to begin their own coffee addiction.
