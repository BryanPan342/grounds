Last week, I talked about the genesis of my coffee addiction. It honestly still amazes me how the "land down under" managed to perfect their coffee. In many ways, Australia's coffee culture shows the true cultural power of globalization and immigration. See during World War II, the Italian and Greek families fled from their home and immigrated to countries like Australia. With their families, these immigrants brought their traditions and values but, most importantly, they brought their stovetop coffee makers. Thanks, Hitler.
<br/>  
While all the rest of the world was buried by the convenience-driven coffee culture of the First and Second Wave movement, Australia was fearlessly experimenting with traditional Italian espresso-making by bastardizing it with milk. Despite its Italian roots, Australian coffee was more experimental and explorative as the mixing of cultures sparked new ideas. It's kind of cheesy to say this but, at the end of the day, Australian coffee is just better because the people care more. The emphasis of quality over convenience is a core tenet of their coffee culture that isn't truly reflected in other cultures. Once again, thanks, Hitler. 
<br/>  
In all seriousness, I find it truly amazing the power immigration has on culture. It's honestly so amazing to see countries opening their doors to immigrants because the benefits are so incredibly powerful. The melding of cultures breeds innovation both culturally and intellectually. In the world of coffee, you can thank Australia for popularizing anything from macchiatos to flat whites. In many ways, I find the best qualities of the world are at the intersection between different ideologies; coffee is no different.

Next to my school is an Australian cafe called **Ministry of Coffee**. Nostalgic of the coffee from down under, I went to **Ministry of Coffee** because I wanted some semblance of obsessive coffee culture. In terms of quality of coffee, it's honestly just okay. All of their coffee is roasted in Sydney and they only have one blend. For an Australian cafe, I find it hard to believe that they don't carry any single origins or other blends. They also don't do pourovers which is my personal go-to order (sad face). That being said, I think they are the only coffee shop that I have been to in Los Angeles that knows how to make a long black. 
<br/>  
In terms of pricing for the quality of coffee, **Ministry of Coffee** isn't a steal in my opinion. Compared to **<a href="https://groundsofthecity.com/location/2020/02/02/sustainability.html" target="_blank">Coffee Connection</a>**, **Ministry of Coffee's** drinks are more expensive for little to no additional value. The long black I ordered was 4 dollars and it was a little watery for my taste. But of course, this is all personal preference and I'm an absolute coffee fiend. I will say though, the smell of **Ministry of Coffee** distinctly reminded me of Australian cafes with a mix of Aussie pastries and espresso. I haven't tried any of their milk-based espresso drinks, but I have hope that they will be much better.
<br/>  
To be completely transparent, I'm not the biggest expert on espresso. Currently, I'm really deep into pourover coffee and I haven't really developed any sophistication on great espresso; so definitely take my opinion with a grain of salt. Espresso is something I want to get into but it's so hard to experiment without a machine. If anyone wants to fuel my coffee addiction and buy me an espresso machine I will immortalize you. But until then, I think I'll stick to what I know best: pourover.
