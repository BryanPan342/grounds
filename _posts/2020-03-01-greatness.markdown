What makes great coffee? This is a constantly evolving question that continues to alter itself as I puddle deeper into this vast space of bean water. It's hard to rationalize passion. Sometimes, things just make sense and there is no logical explanation behind the emotions you feel. I find that true hobbies/passions are ones that challenge your self-image as you struggle to logically comprehend why your pursuing that passion. That sentence didn't really make any sense whatsoever, but I guess that's what I'm kind of getting at.
<br/>  
If you came to me a year ago and asked me what constitutes great coffee. I would have given some shortsighted answer: complexity and balance. While this response is technically 100% accurate, it fails to recognize the nuances of a hobby that makes falling in love with it so easy. In many ways, coffee, like cars or watches, is a commodity and is holistically unnecessary in your life. Logically, it makes absolutely zero sense to be spending considerable sums of money on coffee, but billions of people around the globe do it every single day. 
<br/>  
I have said this before, but I want to reiterate this point. I don't need coffee in my life. The caffeine doesn't really impact my day-to-day in a way that makes me reliant on it. But I do love the act of making coffee and the bitter/sour/sweet taste of it. It's very hard to explain what about the taste I like so much, but I guess I can break it down into what I like. Coffee, inherently, has a sour/sweet taste. This stems from the fact that coffee beans are actually not beans at all. They are pits of a cherry-like fruit. And when we roast these beans, the Maillard reactions impart a savory and bitter quality to these beans. Really great coffee has a unique character, such that you can never have the same exact cup twice. Ultimately, this is what I truly love about coffee. No matter how meticulous you try to make your coffee, it will always taste different and it will always be a new experience.

This week, I went to a coffee shop called **Verve Coffee Roasters**: they are a coffee roastery/cafe chain that is based in Santa Cruz. I actually have been drinking their Costa Rican Line for the past two weeks through my coffee subscription with <a href="http://s.trdcfe.me/MtP3f" target="_blank">Trade Coffee</a>. It's an amazing line of coffee beans with an almost tea-like quality: super clean, tastes like a fruit tea. Their cafes, however, are something else. 
<br/>  
The one I went to was situated in Beverly Hills. One of the bougiest cafes I have ever stepped foot in, **Verve Coffee Roasters** blew me away with their service and interior design. It truly fits the location it was placed in as the sunlight shone through the open space to complement a very Socal interior design. Best of all, their service was so extremely kind and warm. The coffee I got was a Kenyan pourover that came with a little card describing the notes within it. I also loved the fact that they gave me a tiny carafe as a little extra coffee.

The coffee itself was quite amazing. Full disclosure, **Verve** charges each pourover differently as the cost of the beans is inherently disparate. Generally, this is a pretty good sign that a coffee shop knows what they are doing and that they understand the differences between good and great coffee. The Kenyan I had was 6 dollars and to be completely honest, I thought it was a fair price to pay. I know it sounds ridiculous to pay 6 dollars for a cup of coffee, but they honestly give you technically 1.5 cups of coffee because of the small carafe. Quality-wise, **Verve** is a brand of coffee I personally like going to for my daily pourovers. I highly recommend coming to the shops to try out the beans they have in stock and then buying the ones you like online. I have found this to be a great way to understand and appreciate truly great coffee.
