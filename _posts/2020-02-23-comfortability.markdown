Comfortability. Why is it that so many of us want to live a life of spontaneity but implicitly strive to avoid discomfort? Personally, I fear apathy, but I don't actively pursue discomfort. It's easy to say that we like spontaneity, but when it comes to putting action to our words it honestly is so hard. Even in my pursuit of coffee, I find myself defaulting to things that I like rather than actively exploring the vast diversity the coffee world has to offer. For some reason, I find my actions, more often than not, fail to completely reflect my desires, and that bothers me.
<br/>  
I like pourovers, specifically Ethiopian single origins that are light-medium roasted. When I go to a coffee shop, the two questions I ask first are 1) "Do you do pourovers?" and 2) "Do you carry Ethiopian beans?". If they have them, great, color me happy. If not, I settle for whatever beans they have or a cappuccino. While I don't regret having a preference for pourovers over espresso drinks, I do wish I actively tried to truly experience and understand great espresso. After all, how can I be a coffee snob without understanding espresso?
<br/>  
In my attempt to stretch my boundaries and try new things, I recently went to a place called **Millcross Coffee Bar & Kitchen**. Newly opened, **Millcross** seemed to be the perfect place for me to start my journey towards discomfort in the world of coffee. I ordered a macchiato. To those who don't know, a macchiato is an espresso drink that is somewhat of a middle ground between a cappuccino and an espresso shot. In Italian, macchiato roughly translates to "stained" or "spotted". Unlike the macchiatos Starbucks and most cafes offer, true macchiato is simply a shot of espresso and a dash of steamed milk.

I've had macchiato before, but never done extremely well. Most are either too sweet (too much milk) or too bitter (basically espresso). The macchiato I had at **Millcross**, on the other hand, was amazing. Not only did it taste amazing, but it looked absolutely beautiful. One of my favorite aspects of espresso drinks is latte art. Macchiatos inherently use little milk and are smaller than lattes, so the fact that they were able to do something like this is actually insane. For someone who is used to staring at the dark abyss of black coffee, I find the expressionistic quality of espresso drinks fascinating and refreshing. Wow, it truly is these small moments that I realize how much I love coffee. 
<br/>  
I want to end by expanding on the notion of taste. When I tell someone that a coffee taste amazing, most people just look at me like an animal at the zoo. Taste is something that is highly subjective, but I want to share my opinion and thoughts on tasting coffee. Personally, I generally enjoy coffee that are complex and bright. Now what exactly does this mean? If you think about your typical diner coffee, you probably think of an inoffensive, bold, coffee that is piping hot. It's not particularly special or flavorful, it just tastes like plain old coffee. 
<br/>  
Complexity simply means that the coffee flavor evolves over time and tastes more than just plain coffee. How is this possible? Chemical compounds. I plan to go over the whole process of taste in a later post, but simply put, coffee from different places of the world produces a different flavor profile. Some are more acidic than others and others are more bitter. A bright coffee is more acidic because that acidity is born from compounds that are inherently citrusy in flavor. Most Ethiopians produce a bright taste and I personally find that this acidity perfectly complements the bitterness of the coffee. Next time you get a coffee, let it sit in your mouth just a tad longer and try to think about what you are tasting. You might surprise yourself and find that the flavor of the coffee changes or becomes more transparent!
