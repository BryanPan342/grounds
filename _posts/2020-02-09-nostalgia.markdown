The other day, I was at a coffee shop trying an *Ethiopian Single Origin pourover*. Looking back on that cumbersome phrase, I realize how snobbish coffee can sound. Let's break down that order real quick. *Pourover* is a technique that uses percolation (dripping) to extract soluble compounds from ground coffee. *Single Origin* means all the beans are sourced from one origin; this, however, doesn't mean they are all from the same farm. *Ethiopian* describes the place of origin, this only applies to single origin coffee. Now, let's move on.
<br/>  
You might have heard the phrase *Single Origin* before and may have wondered, what's the big deal? We can separate coffee into two groups: Single Origins and Blends. Single Origin coffee has been at the crux of the rise in specialty coffee. They are unique and exotic by nature as all the beans are sourced from the same region, making a region-unique brew. But because of its singularity, Single Origin coffee has a high propensity for inconsistency. For coffee enthusiasts, Single Origins tend to be the clear cut winner as it provides a diverse and fun way to go about trying the coffee of the world. Personally, I prefer the bright, fruity flavors of a *naturally processed Ethiopian* or *Columbian*. It's bold, it's exotic, it's amazing.
<br/>  
Coffee purists might tell you that all blends are terrible. Well, that's wrong. Blends, as the name suggests, are a combination of different coffee bean crops. Back in the day, the first blends were Mocha-Java blends (Mocha from Yemen and Java from Indonesia). But nowadays, we could have blends from all around the world and the understanding of how to make really good blends has changed in the past decade. Done well, great Blends produce a consistent, well-rounded, and unique flavor. With no harsh notes jutting out, Blends provide for an approachable tasting experience that is more suitable for espressos. If you are new to brewing coffee or want a well-rounded coffee that can last you months, then a blend might be the avenue of choice.

Over the past summer, I went to Australia with my mom. Before going there, I had a mild interest in coffee with the extent of my knowledge limited to the core basics and taste. Australia changed all of that. If you don't know, the coffee culture in Australia is insane. Coffee for them is a way of life and must be done at a high standard. For someone crazy obsessive like me, this was doing like crack.
<br/>  
Out of all the cafes I went to at my time in Australia, **Single O** was, by far, my favorite spot in the Central Business District. There is just something about walking up to a coffee bar amidst a bustling city that just speaks to me. The coffee was divine, obviously, and their staff were so friendly. They truly opened my eyes to the world of great coffee and my obsession with Single Origin coffee. Fun fact: **Single O** is credited for popularizing the concept of Single Origin coffee in Sydney.

I guess, in some ways, I cheated a little bit this week by talking about a cafe in Sydney, not Los Angeles. Feeling a wave of nostalgia, I couldn't help but reminisce about the coffee I had 6 months ago. While I may not be able to recreate that specific taste ever in my life, the experience itself has turned me into a coffee fanatic. When I go to cafes nowadays, I always ask if they make a Single Origin pourover. It may sound snobbish, but my best conversations with baristas have always stemmed from that very question. Looking back at the genesis of this infatuation of mine, I can't help but smile at where it all began, **Single O**.
