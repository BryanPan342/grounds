Hello, world! My name is **Bryan Pan** and I really love coffee (like, **really**). As a Computer Science major, I spend the majority of my days with my buttocks screwed into a seat and my eyeballs glued to a screen. I don't know about you, but, sometimes, I like to imagine a world where my life is completely different. Call me a dreamer but I find solace in fantasizing a life in servitude to something personal, something unconventional. 
<br/>  
In many ways, this blog is a big excuse for me to explore and justify my coffee obsession. In many ways, this blog is an escape from the incessant grind of college. But at its core, this blog is a manifestation of my obsessive passion; a creative medium to showcase the real me. While it will most definitely evolve over time, **THE GROUNDS OF THE CITY** will always be a breeding ground of my tender thoughts, absurd assumptions, and maybe, just maybe, some deep revelations. 
<br/>  
As the name suggests, we will be exploring coffee, but more specifically the coffee shops and cafes that act as the foundation for the amazing city that is Los Angeles. From gazillionaires zooming by in their Lamborghinis to everyday Joes hustling towards their dreams, LA is a massive stew of the best parts and also the worst parts of a metropolis. It certainly feels like everyone here is chasing some dream of theirs and I would bet that the majority of them start off every day with a cup of coffee. 
<br/>  
There are so many aspects of coffee that intrigue me. Unlike most, I don't drink coffee out of necessity. I drink coffee because I love it. I love the feel of a velvety body from a mediumly roasted Colombian. I love the way the silky aroma of freshly ground coffee laces my clothes. I love the taste of immediate gratification as the raw complexity of a *Geisha* varietal flushes my taste buds. I know I sound dramatic, if not magniloquent, but humor me for a bit. 
<br/>  
To be completely transparent, **THE GROUNDS OF THE CITY** was born out of an adherence to my values. I believe that every single person is entitled to find something that they love or love something that they find. While this blog is a symbol of my personal values, I hope that you find the content stimulating yet digestible. **THE GROUNDS OF THE CITY** will be an adventure for us to undertake together and I'm excited to see where this journey leads us.
