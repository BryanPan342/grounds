My name is <a href='/author/bryan/'>**Bryan Pan**</a>, I am a second-year Computer Science student at UCLA and I love coffee. My deep fascination with coffee has brought me here, where I write about my journey and thoughts with coffee. Whether it be the relationship between location and taste or the chemical compounds released after the roasting process, I'm continually evolving my understanding of coffee.

<br/>
In many ways, this beverage, that is essentially bean water, is an integral part of people's, and especially my, everyday life. With so much to learn and discover, it feels like the best way to truly engulf oneself is just to get started. This is my leap of faith into the depths of the unknown, a step to explore **THE GROUNDS OF THE CITY**.

**THE GROUNDS OF THE CITY** is a blog that documents my journey into coffee as I explore cafes, roasters, science and everything else coffee has to offer. Along the way, we will find hidden gems, meet amazing people, and attempt to understand nonsensical chemistry. In many ways, **THE GROUNDS OF THE CITY** is a documentation of my descent into bean water madness. Like me, this blog will continually evolve and provide deeper insight into the vast world of coffee.
